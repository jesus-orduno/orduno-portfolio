        WELCOME TO MY<br> 
        PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO
      </h2>
      <p>
        First and foremost, I am a husband and father.  I am also an educator.  After obtaining my M.Ed. in 2013 from the University of Arizona, I dedicated nearly a decade to public education as a high school teacher and as curriculum service provider.  I am now seeking new challenges and opportunities for myself and my family.        
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp with an expected completion date of December 2022.

        Please feel free to look over my portfolio and explore some of the projects I have created.
